The provided code constitutes a JavaScript program designed for the development of a web application known as a Pokédex. This application leverages an API (as indicated below) to retrieve a comprehensive list of Pokémon along with their details, subsequently presenting them on a designated web page. The script establishes an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) named `pokemonRepository()`, encapsulating the Pokémon list and offering methods for adding new Pokémon, retrieving the entire list, and fetching Pokémon details from the API.

Within the code, the `addListItem()` method dynamically generates a Pokémon list on the web page, creating a button for each Pokémon to facilitate the display of additional details. The `loadList()` method is responsible for fetching the Pokémon list from the API, while the `loadDetails()` method retrieves supplementary information for each Pokémon, such as its image, height, and type.

Lastly, the `showDetails()` method showcases the details of a selected Pokémon in a modal, a component from the Bootstrap framework, triggered by clicking the respective button. This modal encompasses crucial Pokémon information, including the image, name, height, and type.

In essence, this JavaScript code employs various web technologies, including HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, and Bootstrap components, to construct an engaging and dynamic web application, enabling users to explore and view details for different Pokémon.

To initiate the project:
The application utilizes HTML, JS, jQuery, CSS, and relies on Bootstrap components.
