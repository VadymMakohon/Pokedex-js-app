Pokemon App

The provided JavaScript code constitutes a web application for a Pokédex. 
This program utilizes an API to fetch comprehensive information about Pokémon, including a list of Pokémon and their specific details, and dynamically presents this data on a webpage. 
It is structured within an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) named pokemonRepository(), which serves as a container for managing the Pokémon list. 
This encapsulated functionality offers methods to seamlessly incorporate new Pokémon, access the entire list, and retrieve detailed information from the API.
