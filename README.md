# Project description


The application loads an initial list of Pok√©mons via an API and displays the items in a grid layout. The user is able to click on each grid item in order to display a detailed modal of the item. The details include the name, the image, the height and the different types of the respective item. Furthermore, the application allows to search for Pok√©mons via a search field. 


## Usage


Click on a pokemon name to show details (name, height and types) of the pokemon as a modal. The modal can be closed by clicking outside the modal, clicking ESC on the keyboard or by clicking on the "close" button.
You can browse through the list within the modal by clicking on the respective "previous" or "next" arrows. 
You can use the search field to search for a certain Pok√©mon. Upon typing the desired Pok√©mons name in the search field a list of search results is displayed under the input field with all matching Pok√©mons and the search sequence. The typed search sequence is highlighted bold and is underlined. The search sequence must not start at the beginning of the searched Pok√©mon.
